1. Print out a fake name
2. Print out a list of 10 names, addresses and phone numbers
3. Load them into an array of hashes
4. Add a prompt: "name?" and the user types a name and you display all names that match those letters
5. If user types <enter> (i.e. a null string) print a list of all the names in a nice phonebook format
6. If the prompt starts with "+" then have user enter a new name.
7. Save the list of names onto disk
